China | Tracking the hacking
China’s POWER is growing rapidly every year. From warships to missiles, the country is churning out hardware at an extraordinary rate. In the unseen, online world, it is making similar leaps. On March 4th America’s Justice Department charged eight Chinese nationals with large-scale hacking of government agencies, news outlets and dissidents in America and around the world, on behalf of i-Soon, a Chinese company, at the direction of the Chinese government. It also indicted two officials who it said “directed the hacks”.
These instances are the tip of a vast iceberg. Over the past decade China’s hacking programme has grown rapidly, to the point that in 2023 Christopher Wray, then the FBI director, noted it was larger than that of every other major nation combined. China’s growing heft and sophistication have yielded success in three main areas.
The first is political espionage, linked primarily to the Ministry of State Security (MSS), China’s foreign-intelligence service. Last year it emerged that one group of Chinese hackers, dubbed Salt Typhoon, had breached at least nine American phone companies, giving them access to the calls and messages of important officials. Ciaran Martin, who led Britain’s cyber-defence agency from 2016 to 2020, compares it to the revelations in 2013 by Edward Snowden, a government contractor, that American spy agencies were conducting cyber-espionage on a huge scale. China was “gaining vast access to the nation’s communications via a strategic spying operation of breathtaking audacity,” he says.
A second is in domains of little espionage value: hacking that lays the groundwork for sabotage in moments of crisis or war. These efforts are led by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), China’s armed forces. In 2023 it became apparent that a PLA-linked hacking group known as Volt Typhoon had, over several years, burrowed into an extraordinary range of American critical infrastructure, from ports to factories to water-treatment plants, across the continental United States and in strategic American territories such as Guam.
All of that builds on a third type of hacking: the industrial-scale theft of intellectual property. In 2013 Mandiant, a cyber-threat intelligence firm, which is now part of Google, made waves when it exposed “APT1”, the label for a group of hackers linked to the PLA. APT1 was not focused on stealing political secrets or turning off power grids but on stealing blueprints, manufacturing processes and business plans from American firms. A year later America’s government took the then unprecedented step of indicting five PLA hackers for this activity. Keith Alexander, a former head of the National Security Agency (NSA), America’s signals-intelligence service, described this as “the greatest transfer of wealth in history”.
That period ended with a partial truce. In 2015 Barack Obama, then America’s president, and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, announced a “common understanding”. Neither country would conduct cyber-espionage to steal intellectual property. The agreement worked. Shortly afterwards commercial espionage of this sort fell dramatically, if temporarily. But that was simply the start of the new era of political espionage and sabotage.
All of these areas have been affected by three big shifts within China’s hacking programmes. One is who is doing the hacking. In 2015-16, shortly after being shocked by the Snowden revelations, China reshuffled its cyber forces. The PLA was forced to retrench, focusing on military intelligence and reconnaissance—like Volt Typhoon—and its activity declined. The MSS took over political-intelligence gathering—like Salt Typhoon—which it conducted with gusto, and commercial espionage, which continued on a smaller scale. “Nowadays,” writes Tom Uren, author of “Risky Business”, a cyber newsletter, “the MSS is the big kahuna.”
Second, Chinese hacking got better. About 20 years ago, when cyber-security firms began tracking the threat, Chinese hackers were “very, very loud”, says John Hultquist of Mandiant, “incredibly willing to set off alarms, incredibly willing to be caught”. A European official concurs. Even five years ago, she says, “Chinese cyber operators were not considered very sophisticated.” That has now changed. “The speed at which they improve always seems to come as a surprise to Westerners, even though it really shouldn’t,” says the official. “If China wants to accelerate in an area, then they will, and they have very smart people.”
That points to a third shift. Chinese cyber operations now draw increasingly on a large and flourishing private-sector ecosystem which has become a talent pipeline, enabler and force multiplier for Chinese cyber operations around the world. Consider the MSS-linked Tianfu Cup in the south-western city of Chengdu (which has emerged as a hub for this kind of activity). It is one of many “capture the flag” (CTF) competitions in which tech-savvy youngsters compete to show off their hacking prowess by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in software. China has hosted about 130 of these sorts of events since 2004, most of them after 2014, and many backed by government ministries, according to data collected by Dakota Cary, a consultant at SentinelOne, a cyber-security company, and Eugenio Benincasa of the Centre for Security Studies at ETH Zurich.
These events can draw huge crowds. The Wangding Cup is organised by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), which runs the country’s police force and gathers domestic intelligence. The cup is known as the “cyber-security Olympics” and can attract 30,000 people, note Mr Cary and Mr Benincasa. The tournaments are scouting grounds for Chinese spooks. As with elite sports, a handful of star hackers tend to drive a team’s success. A decade ago Chinese hackers were allowed to travel to contests abroad; that is now restricted. The vulnerabilities they discover—weaknesses in code that can be used to gain access—“are siphoned straight into the state apparatus”, says a person familiar with the process. In 2021 the government punished Alibaba Cloud, a tech firm, for divulging a vulnerability without first telling the state.
Talent contests are just the start. Last year, documents belonging to i-Soon were leaked on the internet. They showed that the firm was functioning as a private signals-intelligence agency whose targets spanned 23 countries: Nepal’s presidential palace, road-mapping data from Taiwan, South Korean telephone logs, Indian immigration systems and Thailand’s intelligence service. i-Soon is one of many such firms in Chengdu.
The firms are not unstoppable ninjas—the leaked files show evidence of internal arguments, disorganisation and failure—but they add to China’s cyber heft. Even where MSS hackers do the hacking themselves, they often rely on this corporate hinterland for the tools and infrastructure to enable their attacks. When Chinese hackers first started, they used to come, undisguised, “right out of Shanghai networks”, says Mr Hultquist. Today they make use of operational-relay-box (ORB) networks, built and maintained by private firms, which use compromised devices around the world, such as home internet routers, to disguise the origin of attacks.
The increasing scale, sophistication and aggression of Chinese hacking are “by far the most significant shift in the cyber-threat landscape in well over a decade”, notes Mr Martin. Volt and Salt Typhoon, on their own, “are strategic compromises of the West on a scale hitherto unseen by any other cyber power”, he warns.
It is not yet an all-out cyberwar. “What separates China from their peers like Russia, North Korea and Iran”, says Mr Hultquist, is that those states routinely cross the line from espionage to disruption, from spying and reconnaissance to outright sabotage. China has “never pulled the trigger”, he says. Even in American infrastructure networks, China has stopped short of inserting destructive code. “We can see them doing the reconnaissance. We can see them getting into place. They’re not showing us the weapon.” ■

Title: The Chinese government is cracking down on predatory law enforcement

China | Shakedown
To rescue china’s lacklustre economy, the ruling Communist Party is trying to revive the animal spirits of entrepreneurs and rehabilitate the profit motive. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has welcomed Jack Ma, a leading tech boss, back in from the cold, and basked in the reflected glory of DeepSeek, a private AI firm. The government has also recently released five employees of Mintz, an American due-diligence firm, detained in 2023. To get rich is, if not glorious, at least less dangerous than it seemed a few years ago.
But there is one kind of buck-chasing the party is determined to quash: profit-driven law enforcement. This is the over-zealous collection of fees, fines and back-taxes by cash-strapped local governments eager to refill their coffers. In his report to China’s legislature this month, Li Qiang, the prime minister, vowed “resolute steps to prevent unauthorised cross-jurisdictional and profit-driven law enforcement”. On March 24th the Ministry of Finance said it will “resolutely prevent and correct” random charges, fines and levies.
Such money-grubbing has mushroomed since the pandemic, as conventional sources of revenue have fallen. Last year China’s tax collection fell by 3.4%, and revenues from land sales by 16%. The money raised from fines and confiscations, by contrast, increased by 14.8%.
Desperate local governments have resorted to new and crude tactics to raise money. Last year a mining company in western China was hit with a demand for 668m yuan ($92m) for alleged tax obligations going back 20 years. In dozens of reported cases executives have been detained on frivolous charges and obliged to bribe their way out of custody.
Distance is no barrier. Officials have crossed jurisdictional lines to hit up companies or individuals in other provinces, a practice known as “fishing in distant seas”. Foreigners are not exempt. Last year a foreign investment manager based in Beijing discovered that his local business partner had been arrested. Even though the charges came from a lowly sub-provincial jurisdiction, his lawyers advised him to leave the country immediately with his family, which he duly did.
Scholars have warned of grave damage to China’s private sector. Zhao Hong of Beijing University wrote in December that fishing in distant seas and other abuses “are tantamount to draining the pond to catch the fish”. Zhou Tianyong, a senior official at the Central Party School, a training institute for cadres, wrote of the profiteering last September in existential terms. In an online post that was quickly scrubbed from social-media sites he wrote that if local officials keep using the detention of entrepreneurs to boost revenue, it would lead to a “national economic disaster”. Enterprises across the country would collapse, he warned, together with hopes of reviving the economy.
Leaders have woken up to the damage the shakedowns are doing to private business. China’s highest prosecutorial body, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate, has started to crack down. It reviewed 1,500 cases last year and has blocked improper attempts to grab 570m yuan in assets.
As well as legal remedies, some experts propose preventive measures. One idea is that all seized assets should be handed over to the central authorities. That would reduce the incentive for local officials to overreach. The central government is also trying to find less painful ways to fill local coffers. In November it said it would let provinces issue extra bonds worth 6trn yuan over the next three years to replace more expensive, “hidden” debts. This should give local governments more financial breathing room and a less compelling need to gouge their constituents.
In the long term, China needs to reform the unbalanced fiscal relations between the central government, which collects 45% of China’s revenues, and local governments, which have to carry out 85% of the public spending. If local governments were less strapped for cash, they might be less feral about collecting it. Until then, profit-driven law enforcement will remain the bane of profit-seeking enterprise. ■

Title: Estate agents in China are trying everything to sell flats

China | Unreal estate
On the list of professions that are currently flourishing in China, estate agents do not come high up. Houses were once easy to sell, the surest investment available. But as a result of a four-year slump in the market, millions of homes now sit unsold. Some already paid-for properties are not even getting built. New home starts fell by almost 30% in the first two months of this year, compared with a year earlier. As of February, average new home prices had fallen for 21 months in a row.
Around a tenth of estate agents in the biggest Chinese cities have closed since 2021, according to industry estimates. The decline has been even sharper in small towns. Yanjiao, just outside Beijing, has seen hundreds shut, says one survivor. Another says his income has fallen by half in three years. So perhaps some of the wilder antics of those still trying to shift flats are understandable.
In recent months 31 men in the southern city of Huizhou bought flats at the request of their girlfriends, perhaps thinking that they had found “the one”. They then discovered that their girlfriends were estate agents trying to sell those apartments and were not interested in marriage. Authorities launched an investigation, telling local media that 15 women, all at the same firm, were behind the scheme and had used a dating app to find their targets. The incident is probably “just the tip of the iceberg”, warned a newspaper run by China’s housing ministry on March 24th.
Some estate agents are offering valuable inducements. Last year a firm in Zhejiang province said it would give out a 10-gram gold bar (worth around $1,000) for each house it sold. A Beijing-based company promised to throw in a holiday home in the seaside city of Yantai for anyone who paid for an apartment in the capital with cash. Other firms have offered everything from iPhones to stakes in a private-jet company.
Another tactic is to slash downpayments. A developer in the southern city of Zhongshan allowed a deposit of just 9.90 yuan ($1.30) for some flats. Developers in the agricultural province of Henan permitted farmers to put down wheat or other crops as a deposit. In 2022 Central China Group, one such developer, ended up with 430 tonnes of garlic after selling 30 apartments, according to local media reports.
Brokers are changing their pitch. Livestreaming is now a popular way to sell houses, with 500,000 agents on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. Some sing, dance and do comedy sketches from unsold homes. In March, “U-bro”, a robot with a camera that shows houses and answers questions, began livestreaming in the city of Wuhan.
Government officials are trying to help by easing developers’ financing woes and encouraging people to trade in their old homes for new ones. But JPMorgan Chase, a bank, expects that in 2025 Chinese property developers will account for two-thirds of Asia’s defaults. Many analysts do not expect a recovery in the Chinese market until 2026.
If there is one group that can see a silver lining, it may be young men. The social pressure for them to own a home before women will consider them husband material is huge. But with prices in Beijing in late 2019 at 44 times average salaries, such a purchase has long proved out of reach for many. That ratio is now down to a mere 32 times. Some young men, if they can work out which of the women are not just estate agents in disguise, may be looking to snap up a bargain and pop the question. ■
